# Release Notes - v0.1.0: Data Cleaning Milestone

**Release Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Pre-milestone Release:** Data Cleaning and Standardization Complete

## 🎯 Overview

This release marks the completion of the comprehensive data cleaning and standardization phase for the Sondondo Valley Parish Records project. We have successfully processed and cleaned three historical datasets (baptisms, marriages, and burials) spanning 1760-1921, preparing them for the next phase of individual record creation and transformation.

## 📊 Dataset Summary

### Cleaned Datasets
- **Baptisms (`bautismos_clean.csv`)**: 6,341 records
- **Marriages (`matrimonios_clean.csv`)**: 1,719 records  
- **Burials (`entierros_clean.csv`)**: 2,198 records
- **Total**: 10,258 cleaned historical records

## ✨ Key Achievements

### 1. Column Harmonization
- ✅ Standardized column names across all three datasets using mapping files
- ✅ Applied consistent naming conventions for cross-dataset compatibility
- ✅ Reduced datasets to essential columns using `usefulColumnsMapping.json`
- ✅ Removed empty columns to optimize data structure

### 2. Data Quality Improvements
- ✅ **Null Value Standardization**: Replaced inconsistent empty values (`''`, `'-'`, `'--'`, `'n/a'`, `'na'`, `'null'`, `'None'`) with proper `np.nan`
- ✅ **Date Normalization**: Standardized all dates to `YYYY-MM-DD` format using `DateNormalizer`
- ✅ **Age Inference**: Processed age-related fields and birth dates using `AgeInferrer`
- ✅ **Names Standardization**: Normalized all name fields using `NamesNormalizer`

### 3. Advanced Data Processing
- ✅ **Place Recognition**: Implemented NER (Named Entity Recognition) for geographic location extraction from text fields
- ✅ **Geographic Standardization**: Processed place names in all location-related columns
- ✅ **Relationship Data**: Preserved and cleaned family relationship information (parents, godparents, witnesses)

### 4. Quality Assurance
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Identified and documented inconsistent date records (birth dates after event dates)
- ✅ **Cleaning Audit**: Comprehensive audit system tracking missing values and data quality metrics
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete process documentation in Jupyter notebook format

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components Developed
- **ColumnManager**: Handles column harmonization and mapping
- **DateNormalizer**: Standardizes date formats across datasets
- **AgeInferrer**: Processes and infers age-related information
- **NamesNormalizer**: Standardizes personal names
- **PlaceExtractor**: Extracts and normalizes geographic entities

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
Raw Data → Column Harmonization → Null Value Cleanup → 
Date Normalization → Age Processing → Name Standardization → 
Place Recognition → Quality Audit → Clean Data Export
```

## 🚨 Known Issues
- **Date Inconsistencies**: Some records contain birth dates after event dates, requiring manual verification against original sources
- **Missing Data**: Certain fields have high missing value percentages, documented in audit reports

## 📈 Data Quality Metrics
- **Missing Values**: Comprehensive tracking and reporting implemented
- **Standardization**: 100% of name and place fields processed through normalization
- **Date Validation**: All date fields converted to standard format with error flagging
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of all cleaning operations

## 🎯 Next Phase: Individual Record Creation

With the data cleaning phase complete, the project is now ready to proceed to:

1. **Relational Key Creation**: Establish unique identifiers and relationships
2. **Individual Record Construction**: Transform cleaned data into individual person records
3. **Probabilistic Record Linkage**: Link individuals across different event types
4. **Network Analysis**: Analyze familial and social connections

## 🛠️ Dependencies
- pandas (data manipulation)
- numpy (numerical operations)  
- pathlib (file handling)
- Custom utilities (ColumnManager, DateNormalizer, etc.)

## 📝 Files Modified/Added
- `project_code/dataCleaning.ipynb` - Complete data cleaning pipeline
- `data/clean/*.csv` - Cleaned datasets ready for next phase
- `project_code/utils/` - Core utility modules
- `project_code/actions/` - Data processing modules

## 🔄 Migration Notes
- All future processing should use files from `data/clean/` directory
- Original raw data preserved in `data/raw/` for reference
- Mapping configurations available in `data/mappings/` for reference
