# Identifying Unique Individuals through Probabilistic Record Linkage: A Case Study of Sondondo Valley Parish Records

Historical parish records provide insights into demographic, social, and familial patterns but often lack explicit unique identifiers, complicating efforts to track individuals across events. This project employs probabilistic record linkage methods to systematically identify unique individuals within a rich corpus of parish records from the Sondondo Valley, Peru, encompassing baptisms, marriages, and burials from 1760 to 1921. Leveraging contextual data—such as names, familial relationships, geographic locations, and event dates—this approach aims to reduce ambiguity, enabling historical and demographic analyses. Furthermore, network analysis techniques will refine matches, attempting to uncover familial and social connections within the historical community. This methodological framework could be replicated in other historical datasets where recognizing entities is challenging, enhancing digital collections through more robust and consistent record linkage.

## Data collection

Data was gathered from parish records of baptisms, marriages, and burials from the Sondondo Valley, Peru, covering the period from 1760 to 1921. Data capture involved manual transcription directly from digitized images of the original documents. All data was ingested into a shared Google Sheet pre-populated with a structured template for each record type. Post-collection, the data underwent manual review to identify and correct obvious inconsistencies and errors.

## Raw data

The raw data files are stored in the `data/raw` folder, containing:

- `bautismos.csv`: Baptism records. 6,340 entries. 36 columns.
- `matrimonios.csv`: Marriage records. 1,719 entries. 66 columns.
- `entierros.csv`: Burial records. 2,121 entries. 37 columns.

These CSV files were exported directly from the original Google Sheets used for transcription.

## Cleaned Data

The processed data files are available in the `data/clean` folder:

- `bautismos_clean.csv`: Cleaned baptism records with standardized columns and normalized data
- `matrimonios_clean.csv`: Cleaned marriage records with harmonized fields
- `entierros_clean.csv`: Cleaned burial records with processed names and places

**Data Processing Achievements:**
- ✅ Column harmonization across all datasets
- ✅ Date normalization to YYYY-MM-DD format
- ✅ Name standardization using custom NamesNormalizer
- ✅ Geographic entity extraction using NER techniques
- ✅ Age inference and data validation
- ✅ Comprehensive quality audit and error reporting

## Personas Dataset

The `data/clean/personas.csv` dataset represents a consolidated view of all individuals mentioned across baptism, marriage, and burial records:

- **personas.csv**: Unified individual records extracted from all three record types
- Each row represents a unique person-record combination with role context
- Includes standardized names, relationships, dates, and geographic information
- Prepared for probabilistic record linkage and entity resolution

**Key Features:**
- Unified schema across all record types (baptisms, marriages, burials)
- Role-based extraction (child, parent, godparent, spouse, deceased, etc.)
- Preserved source record metadata for traceability
- Standardized name and place fields ready for matching algorithms

## Project Status

**Current Phase:** ✅ **Documentation & Visualization** (v0.3.0)

### Completed Milestones

## Technical Contributions

### GeoResolver Library
As part of this research, we developed and published **[GeoResolver](https://pypi.org/project/georesolver/)**, a Python library for geographic entity resolution and coordinate lookup. This library emerged from our exploration of place name standardization and geographic data processing within the parish records.

**Key Features:**
- Geographic entity recognition and normalization
- Coordinate lookup and validation
- Place name standardization for historical data
- Caching mechanisms for improved performance

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install georesolver
```

The GeoResolver library is being actively used in this project for processing geographic descriptors and place names found in the historical records.
